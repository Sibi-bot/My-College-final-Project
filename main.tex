\end{center}
\hspace{1em}This study aims to predict the age group most vulnerable to diabetes in the context of emerging viral threats. We employ and compare two decision-making techniques: Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Real time data on age, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, body mass index and diabetes pedigree function are collected to identify susceptible individuals. The research evaluates the effectiveness of both techniques and recommends the most suitable approach for prediction. Finally, the study offers recommendations for diabetes management based on the finding.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\hspace{3em}Fuzzy Logic, a concept introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965, extends classical logic to handle the concept of partial truth—where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Unlike binary logic, which restricts expressions to strict yes or no values, fuzzy logic allows for a more flexible approach by accommodating varying degrees of truth. This makes it particularly useful for dealing with uncertainties and imprecise information, especially in decision-making processes.\\

MCDM is a branch of decision science that involves evaluating and ranking multiple alternatives based on a set of criteria. In real-world scenarios, decision-making often requires considering various conflicting criteria, and MCDM provides systematic methods to address this complexity. By using MCDM techniques, decision-makers can make informed and rational choices in situations where multiple factors need to be considered, such as resource allocation, project selection, and strategic planning.\\

One of the simplest and most commonly used MCDM methods is the SAW method. SAW is based on the principle of weighted summation, where each criterion is assigned a weight reflecting its importance. The method evaluates each alternative by calculating the weighted sum of its scores across all criteria. SAW is popular due to its simplicity and ease of implementation, making it a preferred choice for preliminary decision-making tasks.\\

By combining fuzzy logic with MCDM approaches like SAW, decision-makers can handle the inherent uncertainties in evaluating and ranking alternatives. This fusion allows for more robust and adaptable solutions in complex, real-world scenarios where precise data may not always be available.

\subsection{PRELIMINARIES}
\subsubsection*{MCDM [9]}
\hspace{1em}It refers to a set of methods and processes used to evaluate and prioritize alternatives based on multiple, often conflicting, criteria. MCDM helps decision-makers identify the most suitable option among a set of alternatives by considering various factors simultaneously.


\subsubsection*{SAW IN MCDM [9]}
\hspace{1em}It is a straightforward MCDM method
used to evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple criteria. It
involves scoring each alternative on each criterion, then aggregating
these scores using a weighted sum to produce an overall score for each
alternative.

\subsubsection*{DECISION MATRIX [9]}
\begin{enumerate}
\item\textbf{Define the Decision Matrix:} Let m be the number of alternatives and $n$ be the number of criteria. The decision matrix $D$ is defined as:
\[
D=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} &\cdots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} &\cdots & a_{2n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} &\cdots & a_{mn}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $a_{ij}$represents the performance of alternative $i$ on criterion $j$.\\
\item\textbf{Normalize the Decision Matrix:} Normalize the matrix to bring all criteria to a comparable scale. For beneficial criteria, the normalization can be done as:
\begin{equation*}
      r_{ij}=\frac{a_{ij}}{max(a_{j})}      
\end{equation*}
For non-beneficial criteria, it can be:
\begin{equation*}
      r_{ij}=\frac{min(a_{j})}{a_{ij}}  
\end{equation*}

\item\textbf{Weight the Normalized Values:} Let $w_{j}$ be the weight assigned to criterion $j$ \\(where $\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}w_{j}=1 $) the weighted normalized score is calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
    v_{i}=\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}w_{j}.r_{ij}
\end{equation*}

\item\textbf{Rank the Alternatives:} Finally, rank the alternatives based on their scores. The alternative with the highest score is considered the best option.
\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection*{FUZZY SET [9] }
\hspace{1em}A fuzzy set is defined by a membership function $\mu_{a}(x)$, which assigns a degree of membership to each element $x$. This value ranges between 0 and 1:

\begin{center}  
   $ \mu_{a}(x)$=\text{degree of membership of $x$ in set $A$ }
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{MEMBERSHIP FUNCTION [9] }
\hspace{1em}Common types of membership functions include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Triangular :$\mu_{A}(x)=max(0,\frac{z-a}{b-a},\frac{c-x}{c-b})$

    \item Trapezoidal, Gaussian, etc
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{FUZZY RULES [9]}
\hspace{1em} Fuzzy rules are expressed in the form of "If-Then" statements. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rule 1:} If the temperature is "high," then the fan speed is "fast."

    \item \textbf{Rule 2:} If the temperature is "medium," then the fan speed is "medium."
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{FUZZY INFERENCE [9]}
\hspace{1em}Fuzzy inference combines fuzzy rules to determine the output based on input values. The most common methods are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 	\textbf{Mamdani:} Uses fuzzy sets for both inputs and outputs.

    \item \textbf{Sugeno:} Uses fuzzy sets for inputs and crisp functions for outputs.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Example}
\textbf{Scenario:} Determine fan speed based on temperature.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Temperature:} 30°C

    \item \textbf{Fuzzy Sets:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Low: $\mu_{Low}(30)=0.1$ 

        \item Medium: $\mu_{Medium}(30)=0.7$

        \item High: $\mu_{High}(30)=0.2$
        
    \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fuzzy Rules:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If temperature is Low, then fan speed is Slow.
   
    \item  If temperature is Medium, then fan speed is Medium.

    \item If temperature is High, then fan speed is Fast.
    
\end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Decision making:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fuzzification: }Convert the crisp input into fuzzy values using the membership functions.

    \item \textbf{Rule Evaluation:} Apply fuzzy rules to determine the degrees of output based on the input fuzzy values. For instance:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Output for Rule 1:$\mu_{Slow}(30)=0.1$

        \item Output for Rule 2: $\mu_{Medium}(30)=0.7$

        \item Output for Rule 3: $\mu_{High}(30)=0.2$
        
    \end{itemize}

   \item \textbf{	Aggregation:}Combine the outputs from all rules. For instance, the overall output membership for fan speed might be: 
   \begin{equation*}
\mu_{Output}=max(\mu_{Slow},\mu_{Medium},\mu_{Fast})=max(0.1,0.7,0.2)=0.7
   \end{equation*}

   \item \textbf{	Defuzzification:} Convert the fuzzy output back into a crisp value using methods like the centroid method:\\
\begin{center}
   \text{ Fan Speed} = $\frac{(\mu_{i}.x_{i})}{\mu_{i}}$
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}
    
\subsubsection*{FUZZY NUMBERS [9]}

 \hspace{1em}A real fuzzy number $A$ is described as any fuzzy subset of the real line $R$ with membership function $f_{A}$ which possesses the following properties where a, b, c, and d are real numbers:

\begin{itemize}

    \item $f_{A}$ is a continuous mapping from $R$ to the closed interval $[0,1]$.

    \item $f_{A}(x) = 0$ , for all $x \in (-\infty , a]$. 
    \item $f_{A}$ is strictly increasing on $[a, b]$.

    \item $f_{A}(x) = 1$ , for all $x \in [b , c]$.
    \item $f_{A}$ is strictly decreasing on $[c, d]$.

    \item $f_{A}(x) = 0$ , for all $x \in [d , \infty )$.
    
\end{itemize}
\hspace{1em}We may let $a = -\infty$ , or $a = b$, or $b =  c$, or $c = d$, or $d = +\infty$. Unless elsewhere specified, it is assumed that $A$ is
convex, normal and bounded, i.e. $-\infty < a, d < +\infty$.[1]
The membership function $f_{A}$ of the fuzzy number $A$ can also
be expressed as:


\[
f_A(x) =
\begin{cases} 
f^L_A(x) & \text{if } (a \leq x \leq b) \\
1 & \text{if } (b \leq x \leq c) \\
f^R_A(x) & \text{if } (c \leq x \leq d) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

where $f^{L}_{A}(x)$ and $f^{R}_{A}(x)$ are the left and right membership functions of fuzzy number $A$, respectively\\
The fuzzy number $A$ is a triangular fuzzy number if its membership function $f_{A}$ is given by
\[
f_A(x) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{(x - a)}{(b - a)} & \text{if } a \leq x \leq b \\
\frac{(x - c)}{(b - c)} & \text{if } b \leq x \leq c \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

where a, b and c are real numbers.



\subsubsection*{TOPSIS [5]}
\hspace{1em}It is a MCDM method that identifies the best alternative based on the shortest distance to an ideal solution and the farthest distance from an anti-ideal solution. The fundamental principle behind TOPSIS is that the chosen alternative should have the closest proximity to the ideal solution while being the farthest from the worst-case scenario.

\subsubsection*{FUZZY TOPSIS IN MCDM [5]}
\hspace{1em}It is an extension of the traditional TOPSIS method that incorporates fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making. This approach is particularly useful when decision criteria are subjective or qualitative, allowing for a more detailed evaluation of alternatives.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fuzzy Decision Matrix:} The fuzzy decision matrix D is represented as:
    \[
D=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} &\cdots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} &\cdots & a_{2n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} &\cdots & a_{mn}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $a_{ij}$represents the performance of alternative $i$ on criterion $j$.\\

\item \textbf{Normalization:} The normalized fuzzy decision matrix can be calculated as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    r_{ij}=\frac{a_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits^{m}_{i=1}a^{2}_{ij}}}
\end{eqnarray*}
\item \textbf{Weighted Normalized Decision Matrix:} The weighted normalized values are computed by multiplying each normalized value by the corresponding weight $w_{j}$:
\begin{equation*}
    v_{ij}=w_{j}.r_{ij}
\end{equation*}
\item \textbf{Ideal and Negative Ideal Solutions:} The positive ideal solution $A^{+}$ and negative ideal solution $A^{-}$ are defined as:
\begin{center}
    $A^{+}$={$max(v_{ij})$}\\
    $A^{-}$={$min(v_{ij})$}
\end{center}
\item \textbf{Separation Measures:} The separation from the ideal and negative ideal solutions are calculated as:
\begin{center}
   $S_{i}^{+}=\sqrt{\int^{n}_{j=1}(v_{ij}-A^{+})^{2}}$\\
   $S_{i}^{-}=\sqrt{\int^{n}_{j=1}(v_{ij}-A^{-})^{2}}$   
\end{center}
\item \textbf{Relative Closeness to the Ideal Solution:} The relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution is given by:
\begin{center}
 $C_{i}=\frac{S_{i}}{S_{i}+S_{j}}$   
\end{center}
    
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{BOOLEAN LOGIC - FUZZY LOGIC}

\hspace{1em}\textbf{Boolean Logic [21]: } It is a logic form of algebra where the values of the variables can only be true of false (1 or 0). It is based on binary values and uses logical operators such as AND, OR and NOT. The operations yield binary outcome, making it suitable for digital circuits and simple decision-making processes.\\
    
\textbf{Fuzzy Logic [21]:} It extends boolean logic by allowing for degrees of truth rather than a strict true/ false dichotomy. It uses membership functions to represent the degree to which a variable belongs to a set, allowing for a continuum of truth values ranging from 0 to 1. This makes fuzzy logic useful in situations where information is uncertain or imprecise.

\subsection{FUZZY LOGIC}
\hspace{1em}Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic that deals with reasoning that is approximate rather than fixed and exact. Unlike classical Boolean logic, which works with binary values (true or false), fuzzy logic allows for degrees of truth, meaning values can range between 0 and 1 [23].\\

This approach is particularly useful for modeling complex systems where precise information is unavailable or where systems operate in a gray area rather than in black and white. Fuzzy logic uses fuzzy rules that incorporate degrees of membership. Concepts are expressed in terms of membership functions that define how much an element belongs to a fuzzy set. For example, fuzzy rules might include, “If the temperature is somewhat high, then the fan speed should be moderately high.” Fuzzy operators handle the combination of these rules. Fuzzy logic plays a significant role in decision-making, particularly in scenarios where information is imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete. It enhances decision-making by offering a flexible, human-like approach to handling uncertainty and imprecision. Its ability to model complex, real-world scenarios with degrees of membership and rule-based reasoning makes it a powerful tool in a wide range of applications. Whether improving system performance, facilitating complex multi-criteria decisions, or enhancing user interaction, fuzzy logic significantly contributes to more effective and nuanced decision-making processes. This understanding of fuzzy logic’s role in decision-making can be applied to various projects and industries, leveraging its strengths to address challenges and improve outcomes. In fuzzy logic, the concepts of black, white, and gray areas represent the spectrum of truth values:
\begin{itemize}

\item\textbf{Black Area (True/Yes):} This represents absolute truth, where a statement is completely true. For example, "The temperature is hot" might fall into this category if the temperature exceeds a specific threshold.
\item\textbf{White Area (False/No):} This indicates absolute falsehood, where a statement is completely false. For instance, "The temperature is cold" might be in this area if the temperature is well above freezing.
\item\textbf{Gray Area (Partial Truth):} This encompasses the range of values between true and false, where statements can be partially true or false. For example, "The temperature is warm" can have varying degrees of truth, depending on the context (e.g., 20°C might be considered warm by some but cool by others).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{AUTHORS AND THEIR RESEARCH WORKS}

\hspace{1em}\textbf{Fuzzy Set Ranking Methods and Multiple and Multiple Expert Decision Making, Professor Slobodan P. Simonovic, 2001 [23]} explores the multi-criteria decision-making tool known as fuzzy compromise programming. The research compares various fuzzy set ranking techniques, essential for processing fuzzy information. A thorough sensitivity analysis of three water resource systems is conducted, considering decision-makers' risk preferences, leading to the identification of compromise solutions. One system underwent a weight sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of changing weights on rankings. The findings indicate that the method is resistant to variations in weights. Additionally, the study investigates how fuzzy compromise programming can be adapted for multiple decision-makers by integrating group decision-making approaches.\\

\textbf{ Ranking fuzzy numbers based on the areas on the left and the right sides of fuzzy number, Ali Mahmodi Nejada, Mashaallah Mashinchi, 2010 [15]} propose a novel method for ranking fuzzy numbers based on their left and right sides. This approach addresses shortcomings in recent research that often leads to improper rankings. The authors present straightforward computations and provide numerical examples to contrast their method with existing techniques.\\

\textbf{A Ranking Approach for Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers and its Application, Amit Kumar, Manjot Kaur, 2013 [10] }discuss the limitations of currently used ranking methods for intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) numbers. They propose a new ranking technique aimed at addressing these limitations, facilitating the identification of optimal solutions to imbalanced minimum cost flow (MCF) problems where all parameters are represented by IF numbers.\\

\textbf{Various Fuzzy Number and Their Various Ranking Approaches, Lavanya P, 2017 [12]} reviews ranking formulas for various fuzzy numbers derived from recent research. The paper emphasizes the importance of fuzzy number concepts and associated ranking formulas, highlighting significant outcomes in fuzzy ranking applications.\\

\subsection{DIABETIC AND IT’S TYPES}
Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Normally, glucose from food is used for energy and regulated by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas. In diabetes, this process is disrupted, leading to high blood sugar levels that can cause various health complications. \\
\\
\textbf{Types of Diabetes [16]}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Type 1 Diabetes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Cause:} This autoimmune condition occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As a result, the body produces little or no insulin.

        \item \textbf{Onset:} Typically develops in children or young adults but can occur at any age.

        \item \textbf{Management:} Requires lifelong insulin therapy, either through injections or an insulin pump.
        
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Type 2 Diabetes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Cause:} This type is primarily caused by insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance.

        \item \textbf{Onset:} More common in adults, though increasing in children due to rising obesity rates.

        \item \textbf{Management:} Initially managed through lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, but may also require oral medications or insulin as the disease progresses.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Gestational Diabetes:}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Cause:} This type is primarily Occurs during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased needs, leading to high blood sugar levels.

        \item \textbf{Onset:} Typically develops in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.

        \item \textbf{Management:} Initially managed Managed through diet, exercise, and sometimes insulin. It usually resolves after childbirth but increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.
        
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Other Specific Types:}
  \begin{itemize}
 
        \item \textbf{Secondary Diabetes:} Caused by other medical conditions or medications, such as cystic fibrosis or steroid use.

       \item \textbf{Monogenic Diabetes: }Rare forms caused by genetic mutations affecting insulin production or function.
        
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Causes of Diabetes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Genetics: }Family history can increase susceptibility, especially for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
    \item \textbf{Lifestyle Factors: }Poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are significant risk factors for Type 2 diabetes
    \item \textbf{Autoimmune Reaction: }In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing cells.
    \item \textbf{Insulin Resistance: }In Type 2 diabetes, the body's cells become resistant to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Affection of Diabetes in Body}
\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Glucose Metabolism: }In a healthy body, insulin helps cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream. In diabetes, this process is impaired, leading to elevated blood sugar levels.
      \item \textbf{Cellular Impact: }High blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and nuropathy.
       \item \textbf{Spread in the Body: }The elevated glucose levels affect various organs and systems, causing widespread damage over time if not managed properly.
\end{itemize}

Managing diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar levels, adopting a healthy lifestyle, and, if necessary, using medications or insulin to maintain glucose levels within a target range and prevent complications.

\subsection{SOLVING MCDM PROBLEM }

\hspace{1em}To solve MCDM problems, start by clearly defining the problem and objectives that the decision-making process aims to address. Identify and define the criteria that will be used to evaluate the available alternatives, ensuring these criteria are relevant and measurable. Once the criteria are established, generate a comprehensive list of all possible alternatives that could address the problem or achieve the objectives, and gather relevant data for each option in relation to the criteria [11].\\

Next, assign weights to each criterion to reflect their relative importance, which can be achieved through methods like pairwise comparison or direct rating. Evaluate each alternative against the criteria, and if necessary, normalize the scores to ensure comparability across different scales. Apply a suitable MCDM method such as TOPSIS, AHP, PROMETHEE, or ELECTRE to rank the alternatives based on the weighted criteria.\\

Analyze the results to determine the best options and conduct sensitivity analysis to see how changes in criteria weights or data impact the rankings. Make a decision based on the analysis, providing a clear rationale for the chosen alternative. Develop an implementation plan for the selected option and monitor its performance to ensure it meets the desired outcomes. Finally, review the results post-implementation, gather feedback, and document any lessons learned to improve future MCDM processes.

\subsection*{Working of MCDM method}
 \textbf{Step 1:} Identification of Goal\\
 \textbf{Step 2:} Selection of Parameters\\
 \textbf{Step 3:} Selection of Alternatives\\
 \textbf{Step 4:} Weighting Method Selection of represent Importance\\ 
 \textbf{Step 5:} Method of Aggregation\\ 
 \textbf{Step 6:} Decision making base of Aggregation Results
 
\subsection{STEPS FOR SOLVING SAW}

\hspace{1em}The Simple Additive Weighting method is one of 
the most common MCDM methods. Finding the weighted sum of the performance ratings for each alternative considering all attributes is the basic concept of the SAW method. For this, normalized decision matrix must be prepared [19]. This normalization process results in a scale that makes comparing with all alternative ratings possible [8].\\

\draw [arrow] (process2.south) -- ++(0,-1) -- (end);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\textbf{Step 1:}This is an optional step that helps to conduct the following steps better.\\

The initial matrix is prepared based on the values for m$*$n matrix $r_{ij}$ is the value of the $i^{th}$ criterion for $j^{th}$ object where :

\begin{itemize}
    \item i = 1,2,...,m;
    \item j = 1,2,...,n;
\end{itemize}

Another point is to determine the weights of the
criteria ($w_{i}$) to show their importance. These weights
can be considered as numbers between zero and one
(or by percentages) and considering $\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1}w_{i}=1$\\

\textbf{Step 2:} Normalizing the Value of $i^{th}$ Criterion
for the $j^{th}$ Alternative (Calculating $\overline{r_{ij}}$):\\

The $\overline{r_{ij}}$ is known as the normalized $i^{th}$ criterion’s value for $j^{th}$ alternative/object. This value must be calculated in this step considering whether the problem is a cost or benefit type. The difference is that
in the cost problems the object is minimizing, on the other hand maximizing is the object of a benefit problem. These differences reflect in the $\overline{r_{ij}}$ calculation as follows:\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{r_{ij}}&=&\frac{\min (r_{ij})}{r_{ij}} ; \text{if j is a cost attribute.}\\
\overline{r_{ij}}&=&\frac{r_{ij}}{\max(r_{ij})} ; \text{if j is a benefit/profit attribute.}
\end{eqnarray*}

where $r_{ij}$ is the value of the $i^{th}$ criterion for $j^{th}$ object. The $min (r_{ij})$ is the largest value of the $i^{th}$ criterion when all alternatives are compared, and in contrast, $min (r_{ij})$ is the smallest value for it. Therefore,
 $\overline{r_{ij}}$ is a normalized value for the $i^{th}$ criterion and $j^{th}$
alternative.\\

\textbf{Step 3:} Integrating the Values of the Criteria and
Weights.\\

The integration of the criteria and weights helps
to gain a single magnitude that is the final performance value for each alternative. For this, the following equation can be used for the $j^{th}$ alternative/
object:\\
\begin{center}
    $S_{j}=\sum\limits^{n}_{n=1}w_{i}\overline{r_{ij}}$
\end{center}

\textbf{Step 4:} Ranking the Alternatives to Choose the
best One.\\

In the final step, the best alternative is chosen based on the largest performance value of the $S_{j}$ maximizing criterion, and the smallest for the minimizing criterion. Numerical examples are provided in the literature.\\

Finally, there is another important consideration for the SAW method that is beneficial to be noted
here:\\

The $r_{ij}$ is this method should be positive. According to this requirement the negative values should be transferred to positive ones $(\overline r_{ij})$ using different methods. For example, the following formula can be used:
\begin{center}

   $\overline r_{ij} = r_{ij} + |{min (r_{ij})}|+1$
    
\end{center}

\subsection{APPLICATION AREA, MERITS, AND DEMERITS OF THE SAW}
\hspace{1em}The SAW method possesses different application
areas ranging from business to water management and financial studies. Different studies are conducted based on utilizing the SAW method for ranking and selection purposes [8]. This method can be also integrated with other MADM methods such as AHP, VIKOR, TOPSIS, and ELECTRE; some examples are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ranking the cloud render farm services;

    \item Evaluating the quality of urban life;

    \item Risk assessment in public-private partnership projects;

    \item Selecting the most efficient devices;

    \item Selecting sensors attached to the devices;

    \item Ranking the best resources at the local or lower level;


\end{itemize}

Figure 1  is based on the SAW search term in the “ScienceDirect” database (conducted on 2022/06/2). The figure illustrates that according to the results this method is mostly used in the engineering, computer, environmental, and decision sciences subject areas.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{tab.png}
    \caption{Distribution of subject areas used the SAW method.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{THE BASICS OF THE TOPSIS METHOD AND PROBLEMS OF ITS FUZZY EXTENSION}

\hspace{1em}The classical TOPSIS method is based on the idea that the best alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the greatest distance from the negative one. It is assumed that if each local criterion is monotonically increasing or decreasing, then it is easy to define the ideal solution [18].\\

A positive ideal solution is composed of all the best achievable values of the local criteria, while a negative ideal solution is compose d of all the worst achievable values of the local criteria.\\

Suppose a MCDM problem is based on m alternatives $A_{1}, A_{2}, ... , A_{m}$ and n local criteria $C_{1},C_{2}, ... , C_{n}$. Each alternative is evaluated with respect to the n criteria. All the ratings are assigned to alternatives and presented in the decision matrix $D[x_{ij}]_{m*n}$, where $x_{ij}$ is the rating of alternative $A_{i}$ with respect to the criterion $C_{j}$. Let $W = [w_{1}, w_{2}, ... , w_{n}]$ be the vector of local criteria weights satisfying $\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}w_{j}=1$\\
The TOPSIS method consists of the following steps :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Normalize the decision matrix:}
    \begin{center}

    $r_{ij}=\frac{x_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits^{m}_{k=1}x^{2}_{kj}}}$,i=1,2,...,m;  j=1,2,...,n;
    
    \end{center}
Multiply the columns of normalized decision matrix by the associated weights:

\begin{center}

$v_{ij} = w_{i} * r_{ij}$,i=1,2,...,m;  j=1,2,...,n;

\end{center}

\item \textbf{Determine the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions, respectively, as follows:}
\begin{center}
    $A^{+} = \{v^{+}_{1}, v^{+}_{2},...,v^{+}_{n}\} = \{(maxv_{ij}|j\in K_{b}) (minv_{ij}|j \in k_{c})\} $\\

    $A^{-} = \{v^{-}_{1}, v^{-}_{2},...,v^{-}_{n}\} = \{(minv_{ij}|j\in K_{b}) (maxv_{ij}|j \in k_{c})\} $

    
\end{center}

where $K_{b}$ is a set of benefit criteria and $K_{c}$ is a set of cost criteria

\item \textbf{Obtain the distances of the existing alternatives from the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions:} two Euclidean distances for each alternatives are, respectively, calculated as follows:
\begin{center}

$S_{i}^{+}=\sqrt{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}(v_{ij}-v_{j}^{+}})^{2}$, i= 1,2,...,m\\
   $S_{i}^{-}=\sqrt{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}(v_{ij}-v_{j}^{-}})^{2}$, i= 1,2,...,m 
\end{center}

\item \textbf{Calculate the relative closeness to the ideal alternatives:} 
\begin{center}

$RC_{i}=\frac{S_{i}^{-}}{S_{i}^{+}+S^{-}_{i}}$ ;i= 1, 2, ... , m; $0\leq RC_{i}\leq 1$    
\end{center}

\item \textbf{Rank the alternatives according to their relative closeness to the ideal alternatives:} The bigger $RC_{i}$, the better alternative $A_{i}$. Let us consider a formal fuzzy extension of the classical TOPSIS method in a form which is free of the simplifications and limitations associated with the known fuzzy TOPSIS methods analyzed in the previous section.[1] It is important that such an approach makes it possible to present the fuzzy TOPSIS method in the form of a weighted sum aggregation of the local criteria. Suppose a MCDM problem is based on m alternatives $A_{1}, A_{2}, ... , A_{m} $and n criteria $C_{1}, C_{2}, ... , C_{n}$. Let $D[\overline{x_{ij}}]_{m*n}$ be a fuzzy decision matrix, where $\overline{x_{ij}}=(a_{ij},b_{ij},c_{ij})$ is a triangular fuzzy value representing the rating of alternative $A_{i}$ with respect
to the criterion $C_{j}$. Let $W = [w_{1},w_{2}, ... , w_{n}]$ be the vector of real-valued local criteria weights satisfying $\sum\limits^{n}_{j=1}w_{j}=1$\\

The method of formal fuzzy extension of TOPSIS method consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Normalizing the decision matrix.\\
An appropriate and methodologically justified method for normalization of fuzzy decision matrices was developed in as follows:
\begin{center}
$\overline{r_{ij}}=(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})=(\frac{a_{ij}}{c_{j}^{+}},\frac{b_{ij}}{c_{j}^{+}},\frac{c_{ij}}{c_{j}^{+}})$;i=1,...,m;$j \in K_{b}$,
    
\end{center}

where $c^{+}_{j}=max_{i}(c_{ij});j \in K_{b}$.

\begin{center}

$\overline{r_{ij}}=(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})=(\frac{a_{ij}}{c_{j}^{-}},\frac{b_{ij}}{c_{j}^{-}},\frac{c_{ij}}{c_{j}^{-}})$;i=1,...,m;$j \in K_{c}$,
    
\end{center}
where $a^{+}_{j}=min_{i}(a_{ij});j \in K_{c}$.
This normalization guarantees that $\overline{r_{ij}}\subset [0,1]$ for all i and j.


\item The positive and negative ideal solutions are obtained as follows:

\begin{center}

$A_{+}=\{\overline{r^{+}_{1}},\overline{r^{+}_{2}},...,\overline{r^{+}_{n}}\}=\{max\{(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})\}|j\in K_{b}, min\{(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})\}|j\in K_{c}\},$


$A_{-}=\{\overline{r^{-}_{1}},\overline{r^{-}_{2}},...,\overline{r^{-}_{n}}\}=\{min\{(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})\}|j\in K_{b}, max\{(r_{ij}^{L},r_{ij}^{M},r_{ij}^{U})\}|j\in K_{c}\},$
  
\end{center}
\item Calculation of separation of each alternative from the positive and negative ideal solutions.

\begin{center}

$\overline{r_{j}^{+}} \geq \overline{r_{ij}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{b}$

$\overline{r_{ij}} \geq \overline{r_{j}^{+}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{c}$

$\overline{r_{ij}} \geq \overline{r_{j}^{-}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{b}$

$\overline{r_{j}^{-}} \geq \overline{r_{ij}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{c}$
    
\end{center}

Therefore, there is no need to use n-dimensional Euclidean or Hamming distances for obtaining $S_{i}^{+}$and $S_{i}^{-}$ i = 1, 2,..., m, as they can be calculated as follows:

\begin{center}  

$S_{i}^{+}=\sum\limits_{j \in K_{b}}w_{j}(\overline{r_{j}^{+}}-\overline{r_{ij}})+\sum\limits_{j \in K_{c}}w_{j}(\overline{r_{ij}}-\overline{r_{j}^{+}})$

$S_{i}^{-}=\sum\limits_{j \in K_{b}}w_{j}(\overline{r_{ij}}-\overline{r_{j}^{-}})+\sum\limits_{j \in K_{c}}w_{j}(\overline{r_{j}^{-}}-\overline{r_{ij}})$

\end{center}

These expressions make it possible to look at the problem from another point of view. We can see that the expressions 

\begin{center}

$\overline{r_{j}^{+}} - \overline{r_{ij}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{b}$

$\overline{r_{ij}} - \overline{r_{j}^{+}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{c}$

$\overline{r_{ij}} - \overline{r_{j}^{-}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{b}$

$\overline{r_{j}^{-}} - \overline{r_{ij}} , i=1,2...m , j \in K_{c}$
    
\end{center}

may be treated as modified values of local criteria based on the initial ones. Therefore, expressions may be considered as the weighted sum aggregation s of local criteria. Nevertheless, this aggregation cannot be treated as unique nor as the best one within the framework of the fuzzy TOPSIS method in all case 
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

An important property of weighted sum aggregation is that the small values of some local criteria may be counterbalanced by large values of other ones in the final assessment. For example, a high percent of goods of low quality in most cases cannot be counterbalanced by low production costs, just as the low professional qualifications of medical staff usually cannot be compensated for by high quality diagnostic equipment and so on. Since this compensation property of weighted sum aggregation is in many applications undesirable, a decision maker may prefer to use, e.g., weighted geometric aggregation and a more cautious decision maker may prefer aggregation based on the ‘‘principle of maximal pessimism’’. \\

The problem of selecting an appropriate aggregation method is of perennial interest, because of its direct relevance to practical decision making.[4] Generally, the choice of aggregation mode is a context dependent problem. Therefore, in different applications of the TOPSIS method, different aggregation modes may be used to obtain $S^{+}$ and $S^{-}$. Of course, currently the most popular aggregating mode is the weighted sum. It is used in many well known decision making models, but often without any critical analysis. On the other hand, in some fields, e.g., in ecological modelling, the weighted sum is not used for aggregation. The reason behind this is that in practice there are cases when if any local criterion is totally dissatisfied then the considered alternative should be rejected from the consideration completely. Nevertheless, when dealing with a complex task characterized by a great number of local criteria, it seems reasonable to use all those types of aggregation relevant to this task. If the results obtained by using different aggregation modes are similar, this fact may be considered as good confirmation of their optimality.\\

In the opposite case, additional analysis of local criteria and their ranking is usually advised. In addition to the weighted sum, we propose to use other types of aggregations in the fuzzy TOPSIS method. Since different aggregation modes may provide different final rankings of alternatives, to obtain a compromise result, we propose a new method for generalizing the aggregation modes within the framework of the fuzzy TOPSIS method. This method is based on an adaptation of the approach developed, which is based on the synthesis of Type 2 and Level 2 fuzzy sets To calculate the fuzzy values we shall use the a-cut representation of fuzzy values. This means that there are no restrictions on the form of the fuzzy values in our approach and we use triangular fuzzy values in the above definitions only to make the presentation of the developed approach more transferable. Of course, when the fuzzy values have regular triangular or trapezoidal forms, the solution to a MCDM problem with the use of the TOPSIS method can be reduced in its consideration to only the lowest and highest $\alpha$-cuts, practically without any loss of accuracy.

\section{APPLICATION}
The TOPSIS method involves the following key techniques:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Normalization }of data to bring it to a comparable scale.
    \item \textbf{Weighting} of normalized data to reflect the importance of each criterion.
    \item \textbf{Identification} of ideal and negative-ideal solutions for comparison.
    \item \textbf{Calculation} of distances from the ideal and negative-ideal solutions.
    \item \textbf{Computation} of the closeness coefficient to rank alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

These steps help in evaluating and selecting alternatives that are closest to the ideal solution while being farthest from the negative-ideal solution, thus facilitating informed decision-making [22]. The paper also included a dataset on diabetes in which the scale point was fixed using linguistic values some beneficial and non-beneficial attributes are mentioned according to the weightage. The ranking result was eventually discovered, and visualization was displayed using the MATLAB programming language. The major contribution of this paper as follows, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using the average approach, the acquired dataset is categorized by age wise.

\subsection{COMPARISION OF SAW AND FUZZY TOPSIS}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Methodology:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SAW :} This method aggregates scores of alternatives across multiple criteria by summing the weighted normalized scores. It is straightforward and easy to implement.

        \item \textbf{Fuzzy TOPSIS :} This method evaluates alternatives based on their distance from an ideal solution. It incorporates fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision in data.

        
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Handling Uncertainty:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SAW: } While it can use fuzzy numbers, it generally requires precise values for the decision matrix, making it less effective in environments with high uncertainty.

        \item \textbf{Fuzzy TOPSIS: } Specifically designed to manage fuzzy data, it effectively incorporates uncertainty, making it more suitable for applications where data may be imprecise, such as predicting diabetic vulnerability.    
 
    \end{itemize}


    \item \textbf{Decision Criteria:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SAW: } Requires clearly defined criteria and works well when these criteria are independent. It may struggle with interrelated criteria..

        \item \textbf{Fuzzy TOPSIS: } Can handle correlated criteria more efficiently by comparing the distance to both the ideal and negative-ideal solutions, allowing for more nuanced decision-making.  
 
    \end{itemize}

     \item \textbf{Application Suitability:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{SAW: } Best suited for simpler problems with well-defined metrics. It may provide quick results but can overlook subtleties in complex scenarios.

        \item \textbf{Fuzzy TOPSIS: } More appropriate for complex decision-making situations like assessing diabetic vulnerability where multiple overlapping factors and uncertainties exist.
 
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Suggested Method for Predicting Diabetic Vulnerability}

\hspace{1em}Given the complexities involved in assessing diabetic vulnerability in the context of emerging viral threats, \textbf{Fuzzy TOPSIS} is recommended. Its ability to manage uncertainty, evaluate interrelated criteria, and provide a robust ranking of alternatives makes it more effective for this application. By incorporating fuzzy logic, the method can accommodate the varying degrees of risk associated with different factors, leading to more accurate and informed decision-making.
